# What this is

A monorepo to explore different frontend technologies using a simple [TodoMVC](https://todomvc.com/) application.

There is a very simple application in `./packages/vanilla` to get us started. Run it with `cd packages/vanilla && yarn dev` (after `yarn install` on the root of course).

Have fun!
